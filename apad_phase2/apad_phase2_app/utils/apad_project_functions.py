# # Python Utility Functions

# This is being developed for the Project 1 of the Advanced Programming & App Developemnt course (MIS 382N) taught by Prof. Ramesh Yerraballi. These are the utility functions for the operations and access the data from the database created using `dbCreate.ipyng` file.

# ## Function 1: Add a new user
#
# In our application, we are allowing every user to create its own account. Hence, this functionality is not limited only at admin level.
#
# Actionable Sequence of this function:
#
# 1. When user/admin tries to add a single user: [Check](#single-user-input)
# > Calls the `user_input_form` function
# > Asks for user email and then input is checked for an existing user using `email_check` function. <br>
# > Asks for user details <br>
# > Check if password and password_check fields match using `password_verify` function <br>
# > Call the `new_user` function and execute the INSERT query <br>
#
# 2. When admin tries to add multiple users at a time: [Check](#multi-user-input)
# > Fetch the data from `user.csv` <br>
# > Call the `new_user` function and execute the INSERT query <br>
